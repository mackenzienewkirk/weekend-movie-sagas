Description:

Duration - 2 day sprint. 

The goal of this assignment was to make updates to a basic grid view of movies on a web application by adding a details page to display the description and genre/genres of the chosen movie. This included the use of Saga functions in react-redux-sagas to practice the sagas information we learned this last week. This was a fun project to practice the understanding of CRUD applications, and the path from a browser to a database. 

Use of the app -
The use of the app shows a gallery of movies that are already in the connected database. The title and poster of each movie is displayed. If you want to know more about the specific movie, you can click on the poster, and it will navigate you to the details page connected to the ID of that movie. Once at the details page, you will see the title, poster, genre/genres, and description of the movie. At the bottom of the page, there is a BACK button to bring you back to the main gallery of movies. 

Some prerequisites included, Node.js, Postico, and PostgreSQL. I also used CSS to style the page further than what it was originally. 

Built with - React Redux-Saga Node.js PostgreSQL Axios Express
